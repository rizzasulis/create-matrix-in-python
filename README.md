# Create Matrices in Python
A matrix in the world of mathematics is a number, symbol, or expression arranged in rows and columns that form a square/rectangular field. The matrix has size/order. In Python, matrices can be created as needed by specifying the size/order of the matrix. The general form of the size/order of a matrix is mxn, m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.

# Creating a 2x2 Order Matrix
A matrix of order 2x2 is a matrix that has values in 2 rows and 2 columns. In the example: matrixA has: Row 1 Column 1, value = 1 Row 1 Column 2, value = 0 Row 2 Column 1, value = 0 Row 2 Column 2, value = 1.
