# Create Matrices in Python
A matrix in the world of mathematics is a number, symbol, or expression arranged in rows and columns that form a square/rectangular field. The matrix has size/order. In Python, matrices can be created as needed by specifying the size/order of the matrix. The general form of the size/order of a matrix is mxn, m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.

## Creating a 2x2 Order Matrix
A matrix of order 2x2 is a matrix that has values in 2 rows and 2 columns. In the example: matrixA has: Row 1 Column 1, value = 1 Row 1 Column 2, value = 0 Row 2 Column 1, value = 0 Row 2 Column 2, value = 1.

Here is the syntax to create a matrix named matrix A with a size/order of 2x2.
```python
#Matrix A with a size/order of 2x2
matriksA = [ [1,0],[0,1] ]
#Show the Matrix A
print (matriksA)
```
And here is the output of the program
```python
[[1, 0], [0, 1]]
```

## Creating a 3x3 Order Matrix
A matrix of order 3x3 is a matrix that has values in 3 rows and 3 columns. In the example: matrix B has: Row 1 Column 1, value = 1 Row 1 Column 2, value = 0 Row 1 Column 3, value = 1 Row 2 Column 1, value = 0 Row 2 Column 2, value = 1 Row 2 Column 3 , value = 0 Row 3 Column 1, value = 1 Row 3 Column 2, value = 0 Row 3 Column 3, value = 1.

Here is the syntax to create a matrix named matrix B with a size/order of 3x3.
```python
#Matrix A with a size/order of 3x3
matriksB = [ [1,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,1] ]
#Show the Matrix B
print (matriksB)
```
And here is the output of the program
```python
[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
```
